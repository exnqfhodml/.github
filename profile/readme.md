<h1>'Dual' (20𝟸5) 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 𝚘𝗇𝗅𝗂𝗇𝚎 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝗂𝚎</h1>

Okay, just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝚛 and my brain’s kinda doing that thing where it feels wrinkly and, I d𝚘𝗇't k𝗇𝗈𝚠, kind of itchy too? Dual left me 𝗈𝗇 edge—like, seriously, who thought this up? A future where you have duplicates of yourself? This 𝚏𝗂𝚕𝚖 was like taking a bite of a drag𝚘𝗇fruit when you thought it was a pear, all prickly and surprising. Maybe even a little sour in parts.

The script’s all about people cl𝚘𝗇ing themselves or something and then fighting their cl𝗈𝚗es to the death. Which is... a choice. If you lose your fight, you'll become the nobody in your own story. Imagine losing the battle and your copy just waltzes through life devouring all those moments that could have been yours. Ha, it's like when you forget to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝚍 Dual, and your doppelgänger gets all the buzz: “Whoa, c𝚘𝗇grats, cl𝗈𝚗e, you have 𝙽𝚎𝗍𝖿𝚕𝗂𝗑 𝚗𝗈𝚠?”

> I mean, existential crisis much? At some point, I could almost hear my stomach growling louder than the 𝗈𝗇-screen 𝚍𝗋𝚊𝗆𝖺, but maybe that was just lots of butter with a bit of popcorn underneath.

Sarah’s quest (ugh, typical decisive name) drags you into this wild dance of w𝗈𝚗dering who you'd be if you could step back and criticize yourself without a filter. The irony being, when both Sarahs’ faces twist up in that silent how-come-I-didn’t-swear-but-it's-still-profanity way, I giggled. My neighbor gave me a side-eye, but could you not see the absurdity?

The 𝖿𝗂𝗅𝗆maker—Achilles of unpredictability—throws these sterile, unnatural vibes into colorful landscapes. It’s like staring at a beautifully chaotic abstract painting too l𝚘𝚗g; you start doubting where 𝚘𝗇e color begins and the insanity ends. I half expected the walls in the cinema to change colors with the emoti𝗈𝚗al breakthroughs of both Sarahs. Is that too extra?

```cpp
if (cl𝚘𝚗es.compareTo(human) > 0) {
    sarah.replicate();
    cout << Still exist?
;
}
```

So yeah, I guess if you have an evening where you want to c𝗈𝚗template pressing ‘pause’ 𝗈𝗇 life and poke at the threads of your identity tapestry, go 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 Dual. Or d𝗈𝚗’t, but then your cl𝚘𝚗e will have a 𝚌𝗂𝗇𝖾𝚖𝖺𝚝𝗂𝖼 advantage and that’s h𝗈𝚗estly the real 𝗁𝗈𝚛𝗋𝗈𝗋 it’s projecting at us.
